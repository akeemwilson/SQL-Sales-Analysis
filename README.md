SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent, COUNT(*) AS number_of_purchases
FROM SalesData
GROUP BY customer_id;

### 4. Grouping - Sales by Product

SELECT product, SUM(amount) AS total_product_sales
FROM SalesData

### 5. Aggregation - Average Sale Amount
Find the average amount per sale.
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_sale
FROM SalesData;

### 6. Aggregation - Total Sales Amount

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM SalesData;
